# PINNS
This project uses Physics Informed Nerual Networks (PINNs) to solve various PDEs
## Building and Running the Code

---
To build and run the code, the packages required are listed in requirements.txt.
They have verified for Python 3.10. 
```angular2html
(.venv) ~./PINNS$ pip install requirements.txt
```
The project can then be run with any of the mains for the various PDEs. 

## List of Programmed PDEs
